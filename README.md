# Scoreboard

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`


## How to recreate me

### Step 1 - Phoenix
** mix help phx.new **

`mix phx.new ./scoreboard --no-html --no-brunch --binary-id`

Very neat, in config: `generators: [binary_id: true]`

In the future `â€¦ --no-webpack`
(phx.new Docs)[https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/master/installer/lib/mix/tasks/phx.new.ex]


### Step 2 - Schemas
** mix help phx.gen.context **
We will auto generate a context to access these Ecto Schemas

`Player` and `Game` are many to many, using the `Score` to map them together.

```
mix phx.gen.context Games Player players name:string
mix phx.gen.context Games Game games name:string
mix phx.gen.context Games Score scores total:integer player_id:references:players game_id:references:games
```

Easy to create, sure is a lot of boilerplate though.

Let's make sure it works

`mix test`

** Note to self, possibly add Player.games & Game.players as `has_many:through`? **


### Step 3 - Absinthe

TO SELF - Point out verbosity and repeated simple functions of the normal ecto context & the context with Absinthe

Let's try and map our schema over to a graph. Your Graph doesn't have to be anything like your DB, but in this case, ours will.

This is the defintion for the API. Everything that will be exposed and explorable is defined in our `schema.ex`.

 * Basic implementation, we can find some things without traversing the graph

### Step 4 - DataLoader

Point out reduced line count, show a PR maybe.
